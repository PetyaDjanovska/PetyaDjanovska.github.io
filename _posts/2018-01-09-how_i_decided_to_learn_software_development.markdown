Why should someone who already had an engineering career decide to switch fields?
Well, everyone has their own reasons.

As a child I remember coding some symbols on an old Pravets machine and as a result I could see a spiral appear on the screen - that was unearthly, it was mind-blowing! No, really!
Later me and my friend became crazy about a game Lode Runner, which gave the player the ability to create their own mazes and levels, so we did.  We were obsessed :-))

These first experiences with computers had been long forgotten when in 2008 I had to create a website for our company.
I was an electrical design engineer, drawing installation plans who only used WWW for research. And here we are in the middle of a technological revolution - of course we needed to have our own fancy webpage.
So a friend of mine (actually my husband) advised me to try Dreamweaver for that purpose. I was so confused - I struggled for a week, eventually I was not happy with the result and decided this was not for me.

Then technology entered my life more and more demandingly, actually it engulped us all and I litterally witnessed how software could help you automate work, control home utilities, connect you with other people and so much more.

In 2014 there was this point of my life when I had the opportunity to stop, look around and think about how I wanted to proceed, so I took the chance and came up with the following conclusions:

1. I wanted to have a job where I would learn new things every day, because I feel it satisfying.
2. I wanted to do something that would be useful, valuable to people and I could see the results of my work in a short period of time.
3. I wanted to be a part of a team of bright, thinking, intelligent people. As it is said: "If you are the smartest in the room, you are in the wrong room"
4. I wanted to have a good work/life balance.
5. I wanted to be able to work from any place in world, because I love travelling.
6. And of  course I wanted to be paid better - lol, who doesn't!
7. 9 out of 10 engineering job advertisements were for software engineers!!! Impressive, right?!


Coming up with the above, resulted in me joining a software school just to see if coding was a rocket science.
Surprisingly it turned out learnable and I really liked it!

I wouldn't lie - it is difficult, demanding, it is sometimes frustrating, but I found it becomes easier with every problem I solve.
And if I am out of ideas, my teachers taught me:
"Take a rest, do something different and then approach the problem with fresh mind and a different point of view!"
It really works!

Even thought there are ups and downs, coding is still exciting and I am looking forward to the technologies I am about to learn hereafter, so:

"KEEP CALM and KEEP CODING!"
