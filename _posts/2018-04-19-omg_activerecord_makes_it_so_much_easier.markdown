Have you ever wondered how the code you write connects to the database?
It might sound silly, but until recently I thought that it is some kind of an auto magic :-)
Thanks to the ORM (object-relational mapping) section now I know how it is done ... hard, and a bit complicated, far from magic.
But then, Avi talked about [ActiveRecord ](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)- an ORM framework that makes mapping objects and tables SO MUCH easier and fun. Now that is closer to real magic :-)
Make sure to read about Migrations, CRUD and Associations and you will love it.

Thank you, people, you created it!
