Hi, guys! If you, just like me are novices in software development, you should definitely take your time until you feel really comfortable with the topics in Procedural Ruby section.  I think it covers the fundamentals one should understand and master - arrays, hashes, iterations, loops...Iit is like mastering the alphabet before starting to write essays :-)
This is the point where you start thinking as a real developer - how to split the problem into smaller chunks and deal with each one at a time. In order for us to be really efficient in upcoming studies, we need to make sure that we have mastered the knowledge within Procedural Ruby section.
One thing to keep in mind - at all times be aware what your return value is and AVOID AVOID AVOID explicit returns!!!

GOOD LUCK!
